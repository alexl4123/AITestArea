# AITestArea
This area is for testing some AI stuff

I am following the book ''Artificial intelligence, a modern approach''

The exercises/tests will be mostly written in Python.

## The vacuum cleaners dream 

The first one will be a setup of a vacuum cleaner environment,
where a single agent, the vacuum cleaner, cleans the floor tiles.
The tiles are a 2d area, the first agent will be a simple reflex based agent without internal state.
Further improvements to this agent will be added later.
